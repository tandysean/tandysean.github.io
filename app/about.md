<h1>I hate bios...</h1>
  <p>But, I  love hound dogs and writing clean, concise, and descriptive code.</p>
  <p>I Primarily work with JavaScript, CSS and Razor in ASP.NET environment on large e-commerce site. Working on a huge project has truly made me a developer. I have learnt strategies and techniques to successfully navigate a very large and complex codebase contributed to by a large number of teams. </p>
  <p>I adore new technologies and the crazy ever-evolving front-end-stack. I write web-apps using Express.js, Angular.js, Backbone.js, knockout.js, handlebars.js, jade, etc... </p>
