                    <p>With so many tools and frameworks available it's hard to keep on top of what the ideal workflow should be. I have an affinity for the MEAN stack lately, and have been playing around with <a href="elm-lang.org">Elm</a>  and <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> . I find that MVC/MV* is a good way to keep code segregated and Functional Reactive Programming is a really nice way to code. I favor RESTful API's where the front-end handles the payload as a great way to devleop for multiple platforms. </p>
