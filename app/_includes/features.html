                                <p>I love working with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/">fontawesome</a> and <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/">animate.css</a>. I love custom designs too, but depending what you are building this is a really fast way to get markup working and looking great cross browser. I build responsive web apps. The key to great design is consistency and these tools help keep things uniform. </p>

                                <h5>CSS and Markup</h5>
                                <p><a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> is my friend. I don't know how I did anything with CSS before it. Mixins, Variables and partials are so intrenched in my development workflow that I would be very sad without it. I have also worked with <a href="">Less</a>, but it's not as sweet as SCSS. Otherwise, namespacing CSS is great on large teams, but does cause code duplication in certain instances, but with css post processing and minification I prefer it to trying to debug other features you weren't expecting to break by being too faithful to the cascade.</p>

                                <p>I've worked with vanilla JavaScript, <a href="">Jquery</a> - of course, <a href="">Knockout</a>, <a href="">Backbone</a>, <a href="">Marionette</a>, <a href="">Angular</a> and <a href="">underscore</a>. I've worked with custom modular frameworks too. I really enjoy Functional Reactive Programming these days and have been experimenting with <a href="elm-lang.io">Elm</a> which is arguably the future of web app development.</p>
